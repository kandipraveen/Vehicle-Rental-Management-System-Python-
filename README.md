# Vehicle-Rental-Management-System-Python-
A Python-based Vehicle Rental Management System built using object-oriented programming. It supports renting and returning cars and bikes, tracks vehicle availability, calculates rental costs dynamically, and manages customers using real-world OOP concepts.

🚗 Vehicle Rental Management System (Python)
📌 Project Overview

The Vehicle Rental Management System is a Python-based console application developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The system allows customers to rent and return vehicles such as cars and bikes while managing availability, rental costs, and customer records efficiently.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

🧩 Features

Add and manage vehicles (Cars & Bikes)

Customer registration and management

Vehicle rental and return functionality

Tracks vehicle availability in real time

Calculates rental cost dynamically

Displays available and rented vehicles

Maintains total rented vehicle count using class methods

🏗️ System Design
Classes Used:

Vehicle (Base Class)

Car (Inherits from Vehicle)

Bike (Inherits from Vehicle)

Customer

RentalSystem

OOP Concepts Implemented:

Inheritance

Encapsulation

Polymorphism

Composition

Class Variables & Methods

🚀 How It Works

Vehicles are added to the rental system.

Customers are registered.

Customers can rent available vehicles.

Rental status is updated automatically.

Vehicles can be returned and made available again.

Rental cost is calculated based on the number of days

📊 Sample Output

Vehicle rented successfully

Vehicle returned successfully

Available vehicles list

Total vehicles rented
